# Techniques
## Blends
Using this unique prompt, AI image generators like Freepik and Midjourney can create images that blend both photography and illustration together.

* Choose an AI image generator (e.g., Freepik or Midjourney).
* Use this prompt template: "Blending of editorial photography and illustration, model, illustration fashion outfit, surreal environment of vibrant bold illustrations blending 
* with the subject, flowers, smoke, flames and sparkles, half photography and half illustration".
* Generate your image and check out the results.
* Upscale using 2K resolution, add "mix of photography and illustration" to the upscaler prompt, and apply "subtle" and "digital art" parameters.
